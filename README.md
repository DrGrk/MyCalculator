# MyCalculator

Recreating Apple's Calculator. But a little better


Getting Started

Will use programmatic layout design for original portrait layout on any device

Will add in swipe gesture so user can observe their history

Will create a delete button if user has not touched anything for 3 seconds


Eventually...

Set the layout design to fit portrait layouts as well

Add in swipe gesture to pull up a formula sheet IE Metrics

  -This will be a tableview

  -Will either display formula title or the formula itself in the cell

  -Tapping cell will open a new VC (features within the VC have not been decided)
